## Project Workflow 🔄  

### 1. Data Collection 📂  
- The **SuperStore dataset** was collected from **Kaggle**.  
- The dataset contains information about **sales, profits, orders, customers, discount, profit , locations ,etc.**.  

### 2. Data Preprocessing & Cleaning 🧹  
- **Handled missing values** to maintain data integrity.  
- **Removed duplicates** to avoid redundancy.  
- **Converted data types** for consistency.  

### 3. Feature Engineering 🛠️  
- Created **new meaningful features** to enhance data insights.  
- Extracted **date-based features** (e.g., order_month, order_year, order_day_of_week) for time-series analysis.    

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🔍  
- Analyzed **sales trends** across different categories, regions, and customer segments.  
- Investigated the **impact of discounts** on profitability.  
- Explored **regional sales performance** using **Bar Graph**.  
- Identified **top-selling products and least profitable items**.  

### 5. Data Visualization 📊  
- Used **Plotly** for **interactive** and **advanced** visualizations:  
  - **Bar charts** to analyze sales performance.  
  - **Line charts** to observe trends over time.  
  - **Pie-Chart** for analysis by categor
